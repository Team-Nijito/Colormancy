# This .gitignore file should be placed at the root of your Unity project directory
#
# Get latest from https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Unity.gitignore
#

# NOTE: Removed the / below because the unity project is in a subfolder, instead of being in the same directory with the .git file. 
# now, the gitignore should correctly ignore the library files and other problematic files.

# APPEND 1/16/2021: Realized that this may ignore important project files (instead of just the unity generated files)
# So I've appended "Chromaturgy/" to specifically ignore unity files and allow the tracking for other files
# (if hypothetically we had a folder called library, it would actually be tracked)
