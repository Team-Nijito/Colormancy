### 1) What is Colormancy

Colormancy is a 3D multiplayer action game wherein players play as Chromaturges, powerful magic-wielders who are tasked with bringing the gift of color to worlds which know only gray. These wizards combine colors into an almost limitless variety of powerful spells, which they use to spread color everywhere they go. They are not without opposition, however, as ancient Colorless Ones lurk out in the void, and will not take kindly to the playersâ€™ chromatic machinations! 

**_Specification:_**

This is a game project developed for ICS 167 and ICS 168.

### 2) How to play Colormancy:

##### Utilizing the lobby system

If you want to play a game right away, you can simply create a new room and start the game.
Here are some features that our lobby system offers:

+ changing your username
+ creating rooms
+ displaying rooms with their name and player size and capacity
+ joining rooms (that has room for players)
+ changing your region (play with players in other regions)


##### Now that you're in a room...

1) The first level is an intro level, feel free to talk with the NPCs and remember to ready up.
1) The second level is an orb selection level, everyone must select two orbs and ready up.
2) The third level is the second intro level, feel free to talk with the NPCs and remember to ready up.
5) The fourth level is a gameplay level, fend off the enemies while you paint the map. You can see your progress at the top left,
once that paintbrush reaches the right side of the bar, you will move on to the next level.
--) Paint the map.
--) Kill the enemies.
--) Once you've painted the map, you'll be loaded into the 5th map, where it's a different level, but the goal is the same.
--) If everyone dies at least once, you're all getting booted back to the lobby
6) The sixth level is a cutscene level, showcasing how the bosses are going to beat you up.
7) The seventh level is the boss level, fight off against the bosses. If you win, you win the game!


### Actual controls:
[**_camera_**]
1. WASD to move around.
2. Q/E to rotate camera
3. Scroll forward/ backwards to zoom in /out.

[**_spell/damage_**]
1. Your normal attack is your left click attack, it's a projectile - try it out. You can also hold down left click to shoot automatically.
2. Your special attacks would be the spells you've obtain in the lobby (hold right click to aim, then let go to attack).
3. Spells are assigned to the keys 1/2/3/4/5 ... etc if there is a symbol in the hotbar, there is a spell with the associated number key (starting from 1).
4. Press the numeric keys to add a "spell" to the queue to the right of your character.
4b. If the queue is full, adding another spell will dequeue the first spell.
5. Once you've obtained 3 "spells" in the queue on the right side of your character, right click to see the preview of the effect of the spell, and then let go of the right mouse button to fire the spell.
6. There are currently no spell cooldown indicators, so you're probably going to have to spam right click.
7. Spells paint the map and all do damage to enemies (in different ways).
8. Currently only the first slot of the queue determines the spell that will be cast.


### Lobby instructions:
1) Pick one orb or more orbs by walking up to the orb podiums, clicking on the podium, read the description, and then click next until you see the accept button.
2) You should see it in your inventory when you picked up an orb.
3) In this current build, you can pick up an orb multiple times.
4) Orbs you can pick up: red, orange, yellow, blue, indigo, yellow, violet, green, quicksilver

5) You will also need two players readied up in the lobby to proceed to the first level.
6) You can spawn as another player by running the unity executable/program again.
7) You can only ready up if you equip an orb.


#### Known major bugs
- If you leave a game and then rejoin it later, you may spawn outside the map or in a weird area.
- Enemy desync, sometimes the animations of the enemy doesn't match their behaviour
- You can one shot the boss with a certain orb
- This isn't a bug, but there is no in-game volume slider.
